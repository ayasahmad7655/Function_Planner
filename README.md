# ðŸš€ My Submission: A VS Code Extension for Function Planning & Code Generation

I have developed a **VS Code extension** that allows developers to **plan and generate code for a specific function** within a file.

## ðŸ›  Limitations in Traycer AI (Identified Problem)
Currently, **Traycer AI** plans and generates code for an **entire file or folder**. However, in real-world development, developers often work with large codebases where:

- **Planning & generating an entire file** is **time-consuming and inefficient**.
- Developers frequently **modify only a specific function** rather than an entire file.

## âœ… My Solution: Function-Specific Code Planning
My extension addresses this limitation by allowing users to:

- **Select a specific function** they want to plan & generate code for.
- **Generate function-specific suggestions** instead of processing the entire file.
- **Enhance daily workflow** by making Traycer AI more practical for real-world development.
